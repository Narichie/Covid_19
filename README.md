## Analyzing the Impact and Trends of COVID-19 Across U.S. Midwest Counties
**Introduction**  
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted communities, highlighting the need for data analysis to track its spread. This study examines U.S. Midwest county-level COVID-19 metrics, including positive cases and death counts, to uncover trends and correlations. By utilizing visual tools, the research aims to identify heavily impacted areas and inform public health strategies for better crisis management.
## Research Question:
How do COVID-19 metrics such as positive cases, new cases, and death counts vary across U.S. counties, and what correlations and trends can be identified from the data?
## Objective:
* Visualize and explore the distribution of COVID-19 positive cases and death counts across U.S. counties.
* Perform correlation analysis to identify relationships between key COVID-19 metrics, including positive case counts, new cases, and death counts.
* Examine temporal trends using time-series analysis to compare the growth rate of COVID-19 cases and deaths across counties.
* Identify high-impact counties with the highest number of cases and deaths and investigate potential patterns.
* Generate actionable insights through visualization techniques such as scatter plots and heatmaps to understand the spread and severity of COVID-19 at the county level
